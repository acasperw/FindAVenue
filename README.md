## Aproach

Was most comfortable using ReactJs as using this and the asosicated technologies would explore a great deal of modern front end web dev.

After setting up the environment, creating lint rules and creating less. Then i setup the functions needed to compile Less > Css and ES6 React (via browserify and babel ) > ES5 JS.

Then i explored via the fourspquer the most relevent API to use, and built this into a on-submit form function to display the relevent results, each result is a single react component, showing off the great use of react's components.

Then i creaeted tests (I know some people like to make tests first! ... :/ ) using different data to test the components.


## Notes

SEO Friendly.
No JS (other then React) or CSS library used to reduce page weight.
AirBnb are great linting rules, unforuntaly they are very strict and only fixed a few plugins, however, perfectly builds.
